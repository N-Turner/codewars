My solutions to various code wars challenges. If you are new to programming or working on improving your core skills, code challenges are a great way to practice both problem solving and programming. 

If you can't solve the challenge in ~20 minutes, take a look at a solution here. Look at it and understand it. This might require you to look up documentaion for code you don't understand. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

Play around with it until you get it. Then implement the solution from memory only, don't look at the solution again. 

Once you can do the base solution from memory, now try the refactored solution.
